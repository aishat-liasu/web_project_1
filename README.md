The website was built with **HTML5** & **CSS3**. The site isn't fully functional as many of the links don't link any where. The future features that can be expected are :

1. other pages will be added such as the mission and professions page.
2. the social media links will be linked to actual social handles.
3. the resources images will be their actual sites.
4. the "buy book" will be linked to a platform where one can get the book.
